title: Truth Hangs Together

Information is true if it is accurate. Poetry is true if it hangs together. Information points to something else. A poem points to nothing but itself. Information is relative. A poem is absolute. The world created by words exists neither in space nor time though it has semblances of both, it is eternal and indestructible, and yet its action is no stronger than a flower: it is adamant, yet it is also what one of its practitioners thought it to be, the shadow of a shadow.

[E.M. Forster, _Anonymity: An Enquiry_]
