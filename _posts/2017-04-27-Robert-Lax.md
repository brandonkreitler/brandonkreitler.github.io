Robert Lax, in a letter to Thomas Merton (October, 1963):

 
never try to saying nothing in a poem (i say): only see it doesn’t say nothing wrong. 
there ought to be a lot more poems (i say) only they shouldn’t say so many wrong 
things. this must all be stopped. more poems, but not so many words and things like 
that.
