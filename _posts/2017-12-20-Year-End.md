Voyagers, Friends,

As Practice Catalogue closes its first calendar year of life, I glance back at some highlights:

[Dan Beachy-Quick on Humility and Vision](http://practicecatalogue.com/2017/08/01/Dan-Concrete.html)

[Olivia Mardwig on the Working Models of Picasso and Matisse](http://practicecatalogue.com/2017/05/01/Two-Models.html)

[Justin Boening on Purity and Plagiarism](http://practicecatalogue.com/2017/09/26/Justin-Boening-on-Purity.html)

[Sarah Schweig on Truth](http://practicecatalogue.com/2017/08/29/Sarah-Schweig-On-Truth.html)

[Dai George on the Problem of Syntax](http://practicecatalogue.com/2017/11/26/Syntax.html)

[Paul Legault on Radical Translation](http://practicecatalogue.com/2017/10/12/Legault.html)

[Sasha Laing on LOVEMONEYDEATH](http://practicecatalogue.com/2017/12/16/LMD.html)

We also gathered a heap of brief readings and editorial scribblings. I hope some of this has been generative, useful.

Going forward, PC hopes to cast its net, increase its community. Consider pitching a (very) short essay or sending a relevant excerpt. A micro-essay might mine something from your own writing practice/life or that of someone you’ve studied. Anecdote, exercise, example, advice, reflection are all welcome. It’s a flexible and mercifully brief format.

Write to practicecatalogue@gmail.com

And lastly, if you suspect PC would speak to any of your people, do tell them about it.
