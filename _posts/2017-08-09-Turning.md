Some history: The word prose came into English by way of the Latin _prorsus_,
itself the contracted form of _proversus_, “to move forward,” as in Cicero’s _prosa
oratio_, “speech going straight ahead without turn.” Notice, however, that this
Latin root of _prose_ has in it the root for verse. It comes from the Greek word
_verso_, the little mechanism on a plow that allowed the farmer to turn a
furrow––or, in terms of literature, a line. In Latin, _verso_ became _versus_ and
its verb form _vertere_, meaning “to turn,” hence the English _vertex_, _vertigo_, and
even the word _conversant_ (“one capable of spinning an interesting tale”). In
other words, when a line of poetry bumps up against whatever it bumps up
against––death, confusion, the other, unknowns, a rough and rooty patch of
impenetrable earth––the line gets to turn around, start over, make as many
running charges at its subject as it wants.
