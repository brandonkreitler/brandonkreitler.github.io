My poems––I should suppose everybody’s poems––are all set to trip the reader foremost into the boundless. 
Ever since infancy I have had the habit of leaving my blocks carts chairs and such like ordinaries where 
people would be pretty sure to fall forward over them in the dark. Forward, you understand, and in the 
dark.

[Robert Frost, in a letter]
