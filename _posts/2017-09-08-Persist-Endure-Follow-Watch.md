To be recognized and accepted by the peregrine you must wear the same clothes, travel 
by the same way, perform actions in the same order. Like all birds, it fears the 
unpredictable. Enter and leave the same fields at the same time each day, sooth the 
hawk from its wildness by a ritual of behavior as invariable as its own. Hood the 
glare of the eyes, hide the white tremor of the hands, shade the stark reflecting 
face, assume the stillness of a tree. A peregrine fears nothing he can see clearly 
and far off. Approach him across open ground with a steady unfaltering movement. 
Let your shape grow in size but do not alter its outline. Never hide yourself unless 
concealment is complete. Be alone. Shun the furtive oddity of man, cringe from the 
hostile eyes of farms. Learn to fear. To share fear is the greatest bond of all. The 
hunter must become the thing he hunts. What is, is now, must have the quivering 
intensity of an arrow thudding into a tree. Yesterday is dim and monochrome. A week 
ago you were not born. Persist, endure, follow, watch.

[JA Baker, The Peregrine]
