It would be an endless battle if it were all up to ego

because it does not destroy and is not destroyed by itself

It is like a wave 

it makes itself up, it rushes forward getting nowhere really

it crashes, withdraws and makes itself up again

pulls itself together with pride

towers with pride

rushes forward into imaginary conquest

crashes in frustration

withdraws with remorse and repentance

pulls itself together with new resolution


[Agnes Martin, “The Untroubled Mind”]
