Unprompted and unplanned, a lot of the writing on Practice Catalogue has plumbed a particular vein: the relationship between existing writing and the writing one now tries to enact. (I’m thinking especially of [Justin Boening on purity and plagiarism](http://practicecatalogue.com/2017/09/26/Justin-Boening-on-Purity.html), [Paul Legault on radical translation](http://practicecatalogue.com/2017/10/12/Legault.html), and [Hilary Vaughn Dobel on iterations of the Odyssey](http://practicecatalogue.com/2018/06/18/Dobel-Three-Odysseys.html).) Depending on the conditions, we use different words for this relationship: influence, translation, rewriting, transcription, appropriation, plagiarism. Perhaps this shared focus shouldn’t be surprising: these words are really just differently inflected descriptions of writing itself.

In a new essay called [“The Words of Others”](http://thediagram.com/galleys/rev_beachybervinlegault.html) (some fragments of which began as notes on PC) I use the work of Legault, Jen Bervin, and Dan Beachy-Quick (plus a Borges parable) to think through these old but still unsettled issues: What does it mean want to write the words of others? What does it mean to wish or require that the words we use be _our own_? To quote:

>Critics can afford aporia; poets need only not to get stuck. The question is how to make a large, less repressed response to influence, infatuation, or love; how to become or remain a writer while not denying the catalyzing experience of reading; how to stay transfixed and not lose oneself.
