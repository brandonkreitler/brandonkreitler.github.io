title: Interpretation and Personhood

What interpretation hopes to extract from phenomenal encounter is knowledge. In
her famous essay “[Against Interpretation](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/PracticeCatalogue/interpretation-and-personhood/9519481-www.coldbacon.com/writing/sontag-againstinterpretation.html?c=263bb460-e49b-4bcf-891f-1453e8ac1cb7),” Susan Sontag argues not so much
against knowing as against the wrong spirit or use of knowing––knowing that
purchases its claim by the diminishment of presence and possibility, the kind of
knowing that supplants Hamlet by The Meaning of Hamlet.

Much of the essay, which is directed at our relation to art, could be adapted to
our relation to ourselves. Artworks are objects to which we’re never sure we
stand in the right relation. We hope that in us, too, inheres meaning, that we
are threaded through with some essential purpose, though it’s difficult to see
these plainly. We cycle through interpretive or explanatory formulae, and an
honest assessment of the process proves only that the formulae are optional. It
seems an unavoidable business, and not obviously errant, though it nourishes
less than we were lead to hope. But just as one value of art is that it will not
obey our ideas about it, so might we be less eager to be reduced to our ideas
about ourselves, and less impressed by them. As Sontag enjoins: “Away with
interpretation until we experience more fully what we have.”
