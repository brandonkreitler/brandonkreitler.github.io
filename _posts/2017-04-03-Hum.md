title: The Hum and Buzz of Implication

You pound out a sentence.  The sentence sounds an echo.  Do not explain, describe, or narrate the echo––it is 
sounding already.  Sound another.  Measure the relation of harmony or dissonance.  Keep the hum and buzz of 
implication (Lionel Trilling’s phrase) alive.
