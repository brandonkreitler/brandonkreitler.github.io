> The utter fatuity of those who say to you, "By â€˜Hadrian' you mean yourself!"
> Almost as unsubtle as those who wonder why one should choose a subject so remote
> in time and in space. The sorcerer who pricks his thumb before he evokes the
> shades knows well that they will heed his call only because they can lap his
> blood. He knows, too, or ought to know, that the voices who speak to him are
> wiser and more worthy of attention than are his own clamorous outcries.
> 
> It did not take me long to realize that I had embarked upon the life of a very
> great man. From that time on, still more respect for truth, closer attention,
> and, on my part, ever more silence.
> 
> In a sense, every life that is recounted is offered as an example; we write in
> order to attack or to defend a view of the universe, and to set forth a system
> of conduct which is our own. It is none the less true, however, that nearly
> every biographer disqualifies himself by over-idealizing his subject or by
> deliberate disparagement, by exaggerated stress on certain details or by
> cautious omission of others. Thus a character is arbitrarily constructed, taking
> the place of the man to be understood and explained. A human life cannot be
> graphed, whatever people may say, by two virtual perpendiculars, representing
> what a man believed himself to be and what he wished to be, plus a flat
> horizontal for what he actually was; rather, the diagram has to be composed of
> three curving lines, extended to infinity, ever meeting and ever diverging.
>  
> Whatever one does, one always rebuilds the monument in his own way. But it is
> already something gained to have used only the original stones.
>  
> Every being who has gone through the adventure of living is myself.
