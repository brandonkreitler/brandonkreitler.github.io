If stuck, cut out or photocopy the first page of a prose essay you admire.  The key is to choose something 
with a textual weave that intrigues you.  Aim to cut the total words on the page by half.  Rearrange and 
rework sentences, make shaper leaps in argument, open fissures in the thinking, put images into new 
relationship, try for inertia as much as for sense.  This process will leave you with a beginning--made of
the stuff of your beloved model but already working differently, already taking the shape of your 
recognitions and perceptual rhythms.  Even canonical writing couldâ€™ve be been otherwise.  Your own writing 
will be otherwise.
