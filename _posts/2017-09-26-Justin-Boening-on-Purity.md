Jorie Graham was an early craze of mine, though I rarely understood her. What I
didn’t understand, however, I could often imagine, sense. There’s a fluorescent
attention in her parenthetical focus, a confidence in her restlessness. Even
when I was unclear about what was happening in Graham’s poems, I was usually
certain of their clarity.

I read Graham less often these days, though a number of her poems still stick to
my ribs. “[Prayer](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/PracticeCatalogue/justin-boening-on-purity/9577497-www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47197/prayer-56d2277b19acb?c=263bb460-e49b-4bcf-891f-1453e8ac1cb7),” the first poem in Never, is one poem I continue to carry
with
me. It begins with a speaker leaning over a dock, watching minnows, thousands of
them, as they swirl through the water. The speaker’s vision expands
incrementally—from the minnow, to the minnow’s school, then to the currents that
envelope the school, et cetera—until what she sees begins to encompass the
invisible.

That’s when the poem really takes off. The opening twelve-line-long sentence,
which is almost entirely descriptive, gives way to a series of clipped
authoritative declarations: “This is the force of faith. Nobody gets / what they
want. Never again are you the same. The longing / is to be pure. What you get is
to be changed.”

I see these lines quoted over and over again on my social media feeds. And for
good reason. It’s an astonishing turn—memorable, assured, wise—and yet, as is
seemingly the case with most hard-fought wisdom, these lines, however striking
and incontestable, are precedented.

Notice, for example, how closely Graham’s “Prayer” cleaves to James Tate’s
“[Consumed](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/PracticeCatalogue/justin-boening-on-purity/9577501-poppywine.com/consumed-james-tate/?c=263bb460-e49b-4bcf-891f-1453e8ac1cb7),” from The Oblivion Ha-ha: “Nobody gets what he // wants”; “never
again are you // the same”; “the longing to be pure // is over.”

Admittedly, I was stunned when I discovered these echoes. Graham’s “Prayer” had
always felt so uniquely her own, so inventive, “authentic” even. I was more
shocked when a friend, Noah Baldino, directed me toward another Tate poem, “[The
Whole World’s Sadly Talking to Itself—W.B.Yeats](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/PracticeCatalogue/justin-boening-on-purity/9577505-www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?c=263bb460-e49b-4bcf-891f-1453e8ac1cb7),” from which Graham’s poem
(unattributably) lifts.

Some—like [Ira Lightman](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/PracticeCatalogue/justin-boening-on-purity/9577509-www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/09/poetry-plagiarism-copying-maya-angelou-ira-lightman-will-storr?c=263bb460-e49b-4bcf-891f-1453e8ac1cb7), perhaps—may condemn Graham, believing she stole this
poem, plagiarized it. Others may feel less indignant, though no less
disenchanted, suspecting Graham uncovered the poem with too little lifting of
her own. How do we understand the imperative that our words be our own, when, in
an enduring sense, they never are? When we give up on the directive to conjure
some pure, unprecedented truth, is there a nourishment or consolation in the
vision pre-existent, foreordained, within language—itself the accumulation of
imaginative acts (Emerson: “Every word was once a poem”)? What is there to gain
by judging a poem that resonates as more than our own—polyvocal, in cahoots,
wiser than us—to be evidence not of its exhaustion but instead of its vitality?
